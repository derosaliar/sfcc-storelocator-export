# sfcc-storelocator-export
Hi everyone!
I've created a Python script to retrieve/extract specific attributes from SFCC standard generated Store Locator XML files and convert them into CSV format.

Also, i have implemented the functionality to process all XML files within a folder, automatically generating the respective CSVs without needing to manually update the filename in the script each time.

Enjoy / Use it well! :)
